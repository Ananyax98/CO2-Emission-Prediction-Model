 The project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict CO2 emissions from vehicles based on attributes like engine size and fuel type. The project aims to analyze key factors influencing emissions and create a tool that helps reduce environmental impact. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to identify the best-performing model. Once completed, the model will be deployed in a user-friendly application, benefiting consumers and manufacturers by aiding in eco-friendly vehicle choices and emission standard compliance, contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.
